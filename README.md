# Django:

Django has its own naming system for all functions and components (e.g., HTTP responses are called “views”). It also has an admin panel, which is deemed easier to work with than in Lavarel or Yii, and other technical features, including:

- Simple syntax;
- Its own web server;
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) core architecture;

- An ORM (Object Relational Mapper);
- HTTP libraries;
- Middleware support; and
- A Python unit test framework.

the Django framework can take on numerous tasks. Django can be used for creating:

- Client relationship management (CRM) systems;
